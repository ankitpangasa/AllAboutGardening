                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Physical Activity</h4>
                Gardening and yard work are moderate-intensity exercises, which we all need every day (for at least 30 minutes). While tending your family garden doesn't require the vigorous activity of, say, running or playing singles tennis, it's still beneficial to your body.

                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Lower Stress, Better Mood</h4>
                Gardening is an excellent stress reliever for a combination of fascinating reasons: exposure to fresh air and sunlight, relaxing and repetitive tasks, and even contact with harmless bacteria in the soil that helps release serotonin in the brain.

                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Outdoor Time</h4>
                Children are prone to spending a lot of time indoors, which can negatively affect their behavior and health. A family garden gets them outside enjoying and experiencing the natural world.
                
                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Better Sleep </h4>
                All of the above (physical activity, reduced stress, being outside) can contribute to more and better sleep for everyone. And better sleep, in turn, can improve kids' behavior and performance at school.
                
                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Healthier Eating</h4>
                Kids who grow vegetables eat vegetables—or at least, they are more willing to taste unfamiliar veggies, which is the first step to incorporating those new flavors into their diet. Adults who garden are also more likely to eat more fruits and vegetables than non-gardeners.

                <h4 class="gardeningHeadings">Projects for Your Family Garden</h4>
                Consult with an expert neighbor, a family member, a local nursery, or a cooperative extension service to find out what plants will grow best where you live. You might consider investing in a rain barrel and starting a compost pile to make your garden more Earth-friendly, too.
                If you have limited outdoor space, planting in containers is a good way to try out gardening. Even if you do have space, starting with containers can be a good introduction to gardening for little ones.
